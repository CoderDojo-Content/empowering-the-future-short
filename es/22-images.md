When promoting your Dojo on social media, in local papers, by email or using leaflets, it’s useful to include a photo or photos of what the event might look like. Like wording, the images you use to illustrate your Dojo are important. While more engaging than text, photos, videos, and other images strongly impact the external perception of your Dojo. It is vital that your images highlight how open, fun, and inclusive your Dojo is.

####  Tips for collecting diverse images

* If you have a photographer coming to the Dojo, be sure that they take images which represent the range of genders, ethnicities, and ages of your Ninjas.

* If you have a very low number of girls attending your Dojo, utilising your girls table or holding a girls event can be useful for collecting images of female Ninjas.

  


#### How can I be certain images are as appealing to girls as to boys?

* Make sure both boys and girls are present in the images you share.

* Share several images, so assumptions aren’t based on one snapshot.

* Use images of children/teens having fun, laughing.

* Publish photos highlighting a variety of projects, including creative and visual activities.
