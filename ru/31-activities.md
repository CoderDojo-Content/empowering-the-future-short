#### Practical and hands-on

Uncertainty about the subjects’ relevance is one of the top factors influencing girls’ interest in STEM subjects, according to a research project conducted by Microsoft in Europe. Girls are more likely to be interested in learning to code when they can visualise what they can do with it and how they can apply it in the real world. CoderDojo New York founder Rebecca stresses the importance of learning code as a skill which can be applied to many other areas, and says that it’s just one part of a bigger picture.

* A hands-on experience is more likely to interest girls. This does not necessarily mean physically hands-on, as in a hardware project, but rather refers to how the learning is presented. Take a ‘Learning by doing’ approach: encourage kids to jump right in and experiment with the code, letting them ‘break’ it and figure out mistakes together with the Mentors.

#### Easy to follow with visible results

A structured activity which has a clear purpose or goal is more likely to engage girls than one which focusses on coding for the sake of coding.

* Start small with short activities which inspire confidence, so that kids appreciate that coding is something they are able to do. Aim to use resources which guide the learner through making a specific project from start to finish, instead of resources which teach programming techniques concept by concept. Not only will this help learners visualise what they are setting out to achieve before they start, but by creating a project they will have something to show for their efforts at the end.

#### Creative

It is important to give girls the opportunity to be creative. Use resources which combine coding with creative topics such as music, storytelling, art, and film. Give them projects which they can adapt and put their own spin on.

* Encourage girls to see technology as another medium for creating.

* For hardware projects, don’t focus purely on the technology, but turn it into a more creative activity, for example by combining it with art, crafts, or fashion. Introduce things like robotics and wearables as new ways to get creative with familiar toys such as LEGO or dolls.

* Emphasise the creative nature of coding itself: often there is no one ‘right’ way to do something, but many possible solutions to the same problem, so try choosing activities which demonstrate this. Perfect examples are resources from a number of Dojos which involve using different ways to make the same game in Scratch.

#### Gender-neutral

In the presence of a majority of boys, it can be easy to \(unconsciously\) lean towards projects themed around stereotypical ‘activities for boys’, such as sports or fighting games. At the opposite end of the scale, when planning activities with girls in mind, it might be tempting to overcompensate by incorporating typically ‘girly’ subjects, or by ‘pink-ifying’ resources. However, doing so perpetuates stereotypes and risks making girls feel pigeonholed.

Instead of using different content for boys and girls, aim to use resources that are gender-neutral for all Ninjas. Female uptake in STEM subjects has been found to be higher where the curriculum is perceived to be gender-neutral. By using Dojo content which is not biased towards one gender or another, you show that learning about technology is for everybody, and you also avoid stereotyping either boys or girls. As a result your Dojo will be a more inclusive space.
