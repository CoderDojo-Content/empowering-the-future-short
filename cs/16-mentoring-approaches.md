It is important that your Dojo’s mentoring approaches support how girls learn and ask for help. Gisela from CoderDojo Ham said that girls in her Dojo had a “different process of asking for help”, and she observed that they seldom spoke up when they were in need of assistance. In pedagogy it is noted that often the loudest children, or ‘squeaky wheels’, receive the most help and attention, whereas those who are shy and don’t speak up when they find something difficult are often assumed to be fine. Thus, less outspoken children can end up being overlooked, even if they are unable to progress. Providing a space for less confident girls can enable them to get the support they need, thereby preventing them from dropping out. Moreover, if they receive assistance and can advance their skills, this will likely help them to build their confidence and thus to speak up in future. See section 4 for specific advice on female Mentors.

#### Teaching bravery

Reshma Saujani, the founder of Girls Who Code, notes that girls are being socialized to be perfect. In her coding program for girls, mentors see this embodied in girls being afraid of not getting things right straight away and often finding fault with themselves. Sometimes girls even prefer to pretend they didn’t try and don’t show their coding attempts to mentors. It is important to explain to girls that trial and error are necessary and useful parts of coding and debugging, and to encourage them to persevere and develop their resilience.

  


#### Fostering a support network

Developing a support network among the girls in your Dojo is another way to help build their resilience. Wendy of Clonakilty explains uses her girls table to try and promote camaraderie among the girls by encouraging them to celebrate each other’s accomplishments. She explains: “Before the National Scratch competition, I had all the girls show their entries just to the girls table. I wanted them to relish the sense of achievement — but I also wanted to show the girls how to support one another, so they could learn how to compete whilst also being happy for each other.”
