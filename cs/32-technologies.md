How a technology is presented can have a bigger impact on its appeal than the technology itself. Below are a few suggestions of technologies which are suited for projects implementing the advice in the Activities section, and which Mentors have found to be popular among female Ninjas.

* Scratch: Perfect for beginners with its friendly drag-and-drop, block-based interface which enables quick creation of animations and games, while also being suitable for more experienced coders. Scratch offers lots of possibilities for artistic creativity and storytelling.

* Mobile: App Inventor is another block-based program which provides tangible results in the form of apps for Android devices. Making mobile apps is both practical and creative, and moreover very much applicable to life in our modern world.

* Web design: Learning languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript gives kids the opportunity to be creative and make something tangible and familiar \(i.e. web pages\).

* Hardware: Projects with Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and micro:bit are great practical activities which give instant visible results. It is important to consider the different ways in which a topic can be framed. The Silicon Docks Dojo has had success in getting girls excited about robotics by incorporating art and crafts into hardware projects.

* Processing: A flexible open-source software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Art-based projects have proven hugely popular with girls across numerous Dojos.

* Minecraft Code Builder: This new immersive coding programme promotes computational thinking and creative coding which appeals to a wider youth audience and in particular girls²⁷.

* Sonic Pi: An open-source programming environment designed to explore and teach programming concepts through the process of creating music and sounds.
