Encouraging girls who attend to return is vital, particularly in Dojos where they are in a minority. Targeting invites to girls who have previously attended and ring-fencing tickets for girls are both effective approaches to this. Some Dojos hold tickets specifically for girls who attended their last Dojo for a week or two before releasing them to the general public. Other Dojos hold a proportion for girls \(anywhere from 20-50%\) to encourage an increased uptake by girls. This method is particularly effective in Dojos which are consistently oversubscribed or sold out but have consistently low percentage of girls.
