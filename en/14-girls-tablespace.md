Many girls can feel overwhelmed and out of place in a predominantly male environment. When there is such a skew, a dedicated table can be a very effective way of creating a welcoming space for girls within the larger Dojo. Girls tables can be particularly effective if you have a very low number \(≤ 20%\) of female Ninjas as well as female technical Mentors. Pete Gegen of Rochester, Illinois Dojo says, “We start girls-only teams, tables, or groups when the percentage of female participants drops very low \(under 20%\). We have seen this approach give very good results.”

CoderDojo DCU, Clonakilty Dojo, and CoderDojo Ham \(among other Dojos\) have set up a table or space dedicated to girls at their events.
