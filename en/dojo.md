Your layout and seating should help to ensure that:

1. Your Dojo is, and is also viewed as, friendly to girls, so that girls who hear about it or attend it feel it is as welcoming to them as it is to boys

2. First-time female attendees are as likely as their male counterparts to return to subsequent sessions and become regulars  

A proportion of any group of people who try an activity for the first time will decide it is not actually something they want to do again. CoderDojo Scotland's 2017 report covering Dojo attendance from July 2012 to December 2016 notes that the percentage of first-time attendees who didn’t return for a second Dojo session was 19 points higher for girls compared to boys \(64% vs 45%\). Furthermore, only 23% of girls returned to more than one mixed Dojo \(39% for boys\). The Dojo’s team notes in the report that “there may be factors in the Dojos themselves which discourage girls from becoming regular attendees”.  


Potentially discouraging layout approaches include:

* Putting highly experienced Ninjas beside complete beginners

* Separating girls in male-majority spaces

* Distancing female Mentors from female Ninjas

* Dividing girls from friends

* Allowing unconscious bias in layout \(seating girls far from engaging areas\)



While there are many ways of creating a welcoming environment, we suggest four key approaches which can be used independently or in conjunction to help attract and retain more girls:

* Keeping peers/friends together

* Experience-based layout

* Age-based layout

* Girls table/space
