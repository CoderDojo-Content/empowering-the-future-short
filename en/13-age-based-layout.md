In an approach similar to the experience-based layout, some Dojos split classes into age groups to deal with space and time constraints, as well as with older attendees becoming disengaged in an environment full of younger Ninjas. If a Dojo decides on this approach, the organisers usually create a space for 7- to 12-year-olds, and another space for 13- to 17-year-olds; you will be able to assess the best split for your group.

If you are contemplating splitting your Dojo by age, it is important to make sure that doing so also supports the continuation of female attendance. Studies have noted that there is a tendency for girls in particular to drop out around the ages of 12-13 as they transition to secondary/high school. At this age, many young people begin to judge activities in terms of whether they support their future and their career aspirations. Accenture's latest report notes that girlsâ€™ career plans appear to be strongly influenced by what kind of work they:

* enjoy 
* see as creative 
* see as beneficial to society. 

Emphasising the plethora of computing-related careers, and how they fit these criteria, is a good way to encourage girls at this critical age to keep attending your Dojo .

Note: We advise against implementing an age-based layout in your Dojo if only 20% \(or less\) of attendees are girls, especially if doing so would divide their numbers. In these extreme cases, we recommend setting up a girls table or space.
