Many Dojos encourage girls to continue attending by creating a beginner space for Ninjas where they “feel safe to express themselves, to ask questions, and to speak their minds” \(Gemma Cagney, Mentor at Silicon Docks Dojo\). Some Dojos do this by setting up a table for beginners, or for those who are new to the Dojo. This space allows beginners to:

* Develop relationships with others who are new to the content being covered

* Ask questions without being afraid that others around them might know the answer

* Make mistakes without worrying that others might see them in a negative light



A beginner's table can help quash what Harvey Mudd College \(HMC\) calls the ‘macho effect’. This term describes circumstances in which a few vocal students, who are more experienced with technology, dominate a group session and thus undermine the confidence of other students, who as a result are more likely to drop out.

Note: If there are particularly experienced and vocal Ninjas in your Dojo, who appear to be intimidating to others, encouraging them to be less dominant can often be accomplished by simply explaining that they might be making others feel less confident, and that they can discuss their experiences with a Mentor instead.
