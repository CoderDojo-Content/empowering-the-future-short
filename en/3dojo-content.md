The content used in a Dojo can influence the level of interest and participation of girls. It is important to make sure that the activities at your Dojo do not reinforce stereotypes, and are engaging for both boys and girls. There are a number of considerations to keep in mind when you are planning the content for your Dojo.

  


Gemma Cagney offers the following advice based on her experiences:

* Find out your female Mentors’ skills and interests, and encourage them to use these when devising session content.

* Spread responsibility for content across a team of people, so they can support and help one another; no one person should be irreplaceable, or crucial to the success of a session — that’s too much pressure!

* Have a catch-up before each session with the entire team responsible for it. The catch-up is the time to go through concerns, raise issues, and share techniques which are working.
