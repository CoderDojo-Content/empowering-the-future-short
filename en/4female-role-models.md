Female role models are crucially important for ensuring that young women develop and sustain an interest in computing, coding, and digital making. A 2016 study conducted by Accenture and Girls Who Code showed that, of the girls who had female role models in the areas of computing and coding, 62% said they were likely to study these subjects in college. Conversely, only 15% of girls with no role model said the same.  


Mentors act as the main role models in a Dojo setting. Across the globe we see a correlation between the number of female Mentors and the number of girls in CoderDojo. In 2016 the percentage of girls among the total number of CoderDojo attendees was 29%, and the percentage of female Mentors was also 29%. Each year since we began collecting data on diversity in Dojos in 2014, we have observed very similar numbers of female Ninjas and Mentors.
